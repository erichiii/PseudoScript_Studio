# Compiler Front-End Final Project Requirements

## Overview
You will build the "Front-End" of a compiler for your custom language. The project covers:
- **Lexical Analysis:** Recognizing your custom vocabulary.
- **Syntax Analysis:** Enforcing your custom grammar rules.
- **Semantic Analysis:** Validating variable bindings and data types.
- **The Explainability Layer:** Your compiler must actively "talk" to the user, explaining exactly what it is thinking at each step of the compilation process.

---

## Specifications

### Phase 1: The Language Specification (Design Time)
Before writing the compiler, you must invent the language. Your language must include:
- **Custom Data Types:** At least 2 (e.g., instead of `int` and `string`, maybe `num` and `text`, or `zolt` and `blarp`).
- **Custom Assignment Operator:** (e.g., instead of `=`, maybe `~` or `->`).
- **Custom Delimiter:** (e.g., instead of `;`, maybe `.` or `!`).
- **Custom Output Keyword:** (e.g., instead of `print`, maybe `shout` or `display`).

### Phase 2: The Compiler Implementation
Your program must accept a single line of code written in your new language. It will run it through the three phases.

#### Step 1: The Lexer (Lexical Analysis)
* **Action:** Break the string into tokens and identify them based on your custom rules.
* **Explainability Layer:** The program must print each token it finds and what category it belongs to.

#### Step 2: The Parser (Syntax Analysis)
* **Action:** Check if the sequence of tokens forms a valid statement (e.g., `DataType -> Identifier -> Operator -> Literal -> Delimiter`).
* **Explainability Layer:** The program must print the grammar rule it is trying to match, and state whether the structure is valid or missing a piece.

#### Step 3: The Semantic Analyzer (Name, Scope, & Binding)
* **Action:**
  1. Check if the value matches the data type (e.g., if type is `num`, the value cannot be `"Hello"`).
  2. "Bind" the variable by saving its Name, Type, and Value into a Symbol Table.
* **Explainability Layer:** The program must explicitly state that it is checking types, and then announce that it is binding the variable into memory.

## Optional Phase: Going Beyond the Minimum (Creative Expansion)
To achieve the highest grades (and compete for the top spots), you are encouraged to add advanced features based on past and future discussions. Examples include:
- **Error Handling & Recovery Strategies:** If the user forgets a delimiter, implement Phrase-Level Recovery to insert it. If there’s an invalid token, use Panic Mode Recovery to skip it and continue parsing. Make your Explainability Layer report these strategies!
- **Control Structures:** Add syntax and parsing for `if` statements or `while` loops.
- **Object-Oriented Concepts:** Introduce a basic class declaration or object instantiation rule.
- **Mathematical Expressions:** Allow the parser to handle `age ~ 10 + 5.` instead of just direct assignment.

## Sample Execution & The "Explainability Layer"

**Legend:**
* `digit` = integer data type
* `~` = assignment operator
* `.` = end of statement delimiter

### Test Case 1: The Perfect Code
**Input Code:** `digit age ~ 20.`

```text
--- STARTING LEXICAL ANALYSIS ---
[LEXER] Found 'digit' -> Identified as DATATYPE
[LEXER] Found 'age'   -> Identified as IDENTIFIER
[LEXER] Found '~'     -> Identified as ASSIGN_OPERATOR
[LEXER] Found '20'    -> Identified as NUMERIC_LITERAL
[LEXER] Found '.'     -> Identified as DELIMITER
✓ Lexical Analysis Complete. 0 Unknown Tokens.

--- STARTING SYNTAX ANALYSIS ---
[PARSER] Checking statement structure...
[PARSER] Expected rule: [DATATYPE] [ID] [ASSIGN] [LITERAL] [DELIM]
[PARSER] Actual structure matches expected rule perfectly.
✓ Syntax Analysis Complete. No structural errors.

--- STARTING SEMANTIC ANALYSIS ---
[SEMANTICS] Checking Type Compatibility...
[SEMANTICS] Variable 'age' is declared as 'digit'. Value is '20' (Numeric).
[SEMANTICS] Types match. No coercion needed.
[SEMANTICS] Binding variable 'age' to Symbol Table.
✓ Semantic Analysis Complete.
```

### Test Case 2: The Semantic Error (Type Mismatch)
**Input Code:** `digit age ~ "Twenty".`

```text
--- STARTING LEXICAL ANALYSIS ---
[LEXER] Found 'digit'    -> Identified as DATATYPE
[LEXER] Found 'age'      -> Identified as IDENTIFIER
[LEXER] Found '~'        -> Identified as ASSIGN_OPERATOR
[LEXER] Found '"Twenty"' -> Identified as STRING_LITERAL
[LEXER] Found '.'        -> Identified as DELIMITER
✓ Lexical Analysis Complete.

--- STARTING SYNTAX ANALYSIS ---
[PARSER] Checking statement structure...
[PARSER] Expected rule: [DATATYPE] [ID] [ASSIGN] [LITERAL] [DELIM]
✓ Syntax Analysis Complete. Structure is valid.

--- STARTING SEMANTIC ANALYSIS ---
[SEMANTICS] Checking Type Compatibility...
[SEMANTICS] FATAL ERROR: Variable 'age' is declared as 'digit', but value '"Twenty"' is a STRING.
[SEMANTICS] Recovery Strategy: Compiler will discard assignment to prevent memory corruption.
```

### 🏆 THE ULTIMATE INCENTIVE
The creators of the **TOP 3 highest-scoring projects** in the class will be **EXEMPTED** from the Final Exam.

## Grading Rubrics - Final Project CS0035

| Category | Excellent (100%) | Satisfactory (80%) | Needs Improvement (50%) | Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lexical & Syntax Analysis** (30 pts) | Flawlessly tokenizes input and accurately checks grammar rules based on the custom language. | Tokenizes correctly but has minor bugs in grammar validation. | Struggles to tokenize or fails to validate basic syntax structure. | / 30 |
| **Semantic Analysis & Binding** (30 pts) | Accurately catches type mismatches and successfully binds valid variables to a Symbol Table. | Checks types but Symbol Table implementation is flawed or missing. | Does not check for logical/type errors; accepts invalid bindings. | / 30 |
| **The Explainability Layer** (30 pts) | Console output is beautifully formatted, clear, and explains exactly what the compiler is doing at every step. | Output exists but is difficult to read or skips major steps in the explanation. | Minimal output. Does not adequately explain the compiler's thought process. | / 30 |
| **Video Demonstration** (10 pts) | Clear, confident presentation within the 5-minute limit. Code execution is perfectly demonstrated. | Video is slightly over time or the explanation is a bit unclear, but code runs. | No video submitted, or video fails to demonstrate the working program. | / 10 |
